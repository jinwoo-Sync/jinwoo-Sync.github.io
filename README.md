This repository contains my personal homepage served via **GitHub Pages** and built with **Jekyll**.

Navigate through the site to see the languages I use, my CV, research papers and reviews, and blog posts with thumbnails, as well as my GitHub contribution graph.

The site uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling and the [AOS](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) library for scroll animations.

Markdown-based paper reviews are linked under the **Papers** section.
The Languages page shows icons for each language, environment and tool. Posts are displayed in a card layout with thumbnails on the home page and the Posts page.
